# Message Masher - A simple message encrypter and decrypter.

This started off as a project from Codecademy to learn about classes, and it's developed into a React/Typescript webpage.

### How to Use

You can type a message into the 'encrypt' field and receive a scrambled message to send to your friend. 
The receiver can then paste the scrambled message into the 'decrypter' and read it.
