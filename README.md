# Message Masher - A simple message encrypter and decrypter.

Want to speak in code to your friends? My text encrypter has you covered.
This started off as a project from Codecademy to learn about classes, and it's developed into a React/Typescript webpage to showcase a message encrypter.

### How to Use

You can type a message into the 'encrypt' field and receive a scrambled message to send to your friend. 
The receiver can then paste the scrambled message into the 'decrypter' and read it.
